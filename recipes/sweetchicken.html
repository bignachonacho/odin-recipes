        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>What makes this recipe so perfect is that the chicken is first fried to get that crisp exterior. Then it gets baked in a low temperature for an hour, really letting the sweet and sour flavors meld right into the chicken. I was worried that the chicken would get overcooked but it was actually so unbelievably tender. And the flavor packs in quite a punch!</p>

            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>for the sweet and sour sauce</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup apple cider vinegar</li>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Lightly oil a 9Ã—13 baking dish or coat with nonstick spray.</li>
            <li>To make the sauce, whisk together sugar, vinegar, ketchup, soy sauce and garlic powder in a large bowl; set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, season chicken with salt and pepper, to taste. Stir in cornstarch and gently toss to combine. Working one at a time, dip the chicken into the eggs.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large saucepan. Add chicken and cook until golden brown, about 1-2 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate; discard excess oil.</li>
            <li>Add chicken to prepared baking dish. Top with sweet and sour sauce. Place into oven and bake until the sauce has thickened, about 55 minutes, turning over every 15 minutes to evenly coat the chicken.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
