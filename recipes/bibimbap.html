        <h3>How to make Bibimbap</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>For meat, mix the beef mince with the meat 
                sauce listed above. Marinate the meat for 
                about 30 mins while you are working on other 
                ingredients to enhance the flavour. Add some 
                cooking oil into a wok and cook the meat on 
                medium high to high heat. It takes about 3 
                to 5 mins to thoroughly cook it.

                wok and cook the carrots on medium high to high 
                heat for 2 to 3 mins.
            </li>
            <li>Clean/rinse the shiitake mushrooms and thinly 
                slice them. Add some cooking oil and 1/4 tsp 
                of fine sea salt in a wok and cook the mushrooms 
                on medium high to high heat until they are all 
                cooked. (It takes 2 to 3 mins.)
