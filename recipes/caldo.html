        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook 
                and stir onion, garlic, and ginger in hot oil 
                until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add chicken 
                wings; cook and stir for 1 minute. Stir in fish 
                sauce, cover, and cook another 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Pour chicken broth into the pot. Stir 
                in sweet rice and bring mixture to a 
                boil. Cover and cook for 10 minutes, 
                stirring occasionally to prevent rice 
                from sticking to the bottom of the pot. 
                Season with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>Portion soup into bowls and garnish 
                with green onion. Serve with lemon 
                slices and additional fish sauce, if 
                desired.
            </li>
            <li>Serve.</li>
        </ol>
